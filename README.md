# Talks I Do

Here is a list of abstracts and slide decks for talks I am actively presenting. Feel free to reach out if you would like me to talk at your Meetup/User Group/Conference

## Accelerate .NET to Azure with GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions makes it easy to automate all your software workflows, now with world-class CI/CD. Build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub. Make code reviews, branch management, and issue triaging work the way you want. With .NET Core bringing a cross platform approach, getting your applications to the Cloud is easier than ever.

In this session we will learn the different ways to deploy our .NET applications to the cloud and how we can use GitHub Actions to make it faster!

## Application Insights: The Tool You Never Knew You Needed

Understanding how our applications function in the wild is essential for developers when issues arise. With the power of knowledge, we can enable ourselves to provide the best experience to our fellow developers, and our stakeholders. One of the solutions that supplies this power is Application Insights. Application Insights is a service provided by Microsoft allowing you to monitor your application live, detect performance anomalies, and observe this data with powerful analytics. Together we will see how easy it is to add Application Insights to our applications, whether we have access to the code-base or not. Once instrumented, we will dive deeper into the capabilities of Application Insights and show how to leverage all the rich data collected from our application. Finally, as developers the last thing we want to do is troubleshoot an issue in Production, with everyone watching and the stakes are high. Watch as we monitor a live application that is throwing exceptions and how Application Insights can be used to help us solve the problem faster. When we are done, attendees will be empowered with the knowledge to leverage Application Insights to be more productive with their work.


## What to Expect When You Are Expecting ASP.NET 6

As the world eagerly awaited (pun intended) the release of .NET 6, developers saw great stories about how the desktop client will be revolutionized by it being brought into .NET. Some people may see that as the web being left out, but that is not the case at all. Now that .NET 6.1 is out and LTS, it is time to take full advantage of the capabilities.

ASP.NET 6 will include many additions that further expands the capabilities of the platform with enhancements and new features entirely. These additions will bring many wonderful things, but it also important to understand how our apps will need to change. Join a demo-filled ride through what you can expect from ASP.NET 6


## How To Work From Home Without Living At Work

In the ever-changing world of talent hiring, perks are king. To lure the best and the brightest to join their firms, more and more companies are giving their employees the option to work from home. Though it sounds amazing at first, over time your professional responsibility can drift into your home life; causing issues around work/life balance. Every person that works from home takes the risk of working more  - and more. Likely without even realizing it, like I did. My work from home story has highs and lows, and sharing where I have been successful as well as unsuccessful can help anyone considering the option. I have also had the opportunity to speak with colleagues who work from home as well, and I want to share what I have learned.

With these exciting opportunities, it is important to declare early on what your priorities are; and how you can ensure you meet those priorities. After this discussion, people who attend this talk will have a new understanding of how people who work from home can be successful.

## Stretch Your .NET App with ElasticSearch

Do you have a ton of data and aren't sure what to do with it? Why not put intelligent search on top of it! ElasticSearch is a Free and Open, Distributed, RESTful Search Engine that gets you to insights that you might not have been aware of.

This talk will be an introduction to ElasticSearch and how easy it is to add to any .NET project.

## An Opinionated Way to Deploy Windows Apps using GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions allows you to build, test and deploy your code right from a GitHub repo. In this session you will see how to use GitHub Actions to deploy your Windows apps to Chocolatey and the Windows Store.
